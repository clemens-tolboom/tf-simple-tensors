# Simple tensors using Tensorflow

This is my interpretation of Chapter 2 of the book [Coding the deep learning revolution](https://adventuresinmachinelearning.com/coding-deep-learning-ebook/) by Andy Thomas.

## Getting started

Install [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) then run

```
pipenv install

pipenv run jupyter notebook
```
